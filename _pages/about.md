I currently serve as an Instructor at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes in the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/research/divisions/radiological-physics#team">Radiological Physics Division</a> of the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/index.html">Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science</a>. I collaborate closely with Dr. <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/yong-du">Yong Du</a> in the [Quantitative Imaging Biomarker (QIB) Lab](https://qib.jhmi.edu/) within the Radiology Department, as well as with Drs. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8kZ64yEAAAAJ&hl=en"> Aaron Carass</a> and <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/jerry-prince/">Jerry Prince</a> in the [Image Analysis and Communications Lab (IACL)](https://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I also maintain an informal affiliation with [KU Lab](https://kulab.jhmi.edu/) under the PI, Dr. <a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/ken-taguchi/2777799">Katsuyuki “Ken” Taguchi</a>, in the Radiology Department.

My research focuses on medical image analysis, particularly in image registration, segmentation, and denoising. I work with various imaging modalities, including nuclear medicine imaging (PET and SPECT), CT, and MRI. I am actively involved in the [Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Society](https://miccai.org/index.php/) as a committee member of the [MICCAI Special Interest Group in Biomedical Image Registration (SIG-BIR)](https://miccai.org/index.php/special-interest-groups/bir/). I have co-organized the [Learn2Reg](https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/) 2024 and 2025 medical image registration challenges at the MICCAI conferences. Additionally, I am deeply engaged with the [Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI)](https://snmmi.org/), where I will serve as a non-voting member of the Board of Directors in the [Physics, Instrumentation & Data Sciences Council (PIDSC)](https://snmmi.org/Web/About/About-SNMMI/Councils/Physics--Instrumentation-and-Data-Sciences-Council/PIDSC-Board-of-Directors.aspx) for a two-year term beginning in July 2025.

My academic journey at Johns Hopkins University spanned from 2017 to 2022, culminating in a Ph.D. under the mentorship of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-K45vUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Eric C. Frey</a>. I hold dual B.Sc. degrees with <a href="http://catalog.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies-procedures/student-status-honors/academic-honors/">Summa Cum Laude</a> honors in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a> (2017), along with M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical & Computer Engineering from <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/">Johns Hopkins University</a> (2019 and 2022, respectively).

<!---My dissertation was successfully defended on October 21, 2022, with heartfelt thanks to my committee members, Profs. <a href="https://pulselab.jhu.edu/muyinatu-a-lediju-bell-phd/">Muyinatu Bell</a>, <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/vishal-patel/">Vishal Patel</a>, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/yong-du">Yong Du</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-K45vUAAAAJ&hl=en">Eric Frey</a>.--->

<!---I worked at <a href="https://www.research.us.medical.canon/"> Canon Medical Research USA, Inc.</a> (full-time in May-August 2020, part-time in September 2020 - October 2021), as a PET Image Reconstruction and Quality Scientist Intern, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h5ZNDBUAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Evren Asma</a> and mentored by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Or4xII0AAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Chung (Jan) Chan</a>.--->

<!---I passed the Graduate Board Oral (GBO) examination in July, 2021. The exam committee members include: Profs. <a href="https://pulselab.jhu.edu/muyinatu-a-lediju-bell-phd/">Muyinatu Bell</a>, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/george-sgouros">George Sgouros</a>, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/yong-du">Yong Du</a>, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/jingyan-xu">Jingyan Xu</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-K45vUAAAAJ&hl=en">Eric Frey</a>.--->
